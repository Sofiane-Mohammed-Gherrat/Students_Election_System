anna_kim|Hi everyone! I’m Anna, a second‑year Psychology major. Over the past year, I’ve served on our department’s peer mentoring team, helped organise study groups, and volunteered during orientation week. These experiences have sharpened my communication, leadership, and organisational skills—qualities I’ll bring to the representative role.
